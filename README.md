# ParCool MOD

---

**Welcome to this project!**

*ParCool* is a mod of Minecraft, for more *Cool* Actions like *Parkour*.  
It's inspired by [SmartMoving](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/smart-moving). That was a very great mod,
but it's abandoned now. I'm so sad.  
(Actually, there are some alternate projects...)

Players can do more actions such as...

+ Grabbing Cliffs
+ Running Faster
+ Roll
+ Backflip
+ WallJump
+ CatLeap  
  etc

If it made you traceurs or traceuses ; parkour practitioners, I couldn't be happier!!
