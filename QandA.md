# Q&A

### Q. Is there any plans of a port to fabric?
#### A. No

It will takes much time of port to other API.  
But if someone is willing to do that, I will accept the contribution.

### Q. Is 1.12.2 version development now worked on?
#### A. Partially Yes

However it will be supported as for only bugfixes.  
New features won't be added.  
And the author is now working on the latest minecraft version so I cannot do that soon.
